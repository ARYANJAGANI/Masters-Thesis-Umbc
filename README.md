## 📘 Thesis Title

**Evaluating Large Language Model–Generated Questions for Early Childhood Dialogic Reading**  
*(Working title — subject to refinement)*

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains all research artifacts related to my Master’s thesis at UMBC.  
The thesis investigates the **quality, pedagogical value, and appropriateness of questions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)** for **early childhood dialogic reading**.

The primary objective is to evaluate whether LLM-generated questions align with **established dialogic reading principles** and whether they are suitable for **young learners** in educational settings.

---

## 🧠 Research Focus

This thesis explores the following core questions:

- Can Large Language Models generate **educationally meaningful questions** for early childhood reading activities?
- How well do LLM-generated questions align with the **Curated Education Rubrics**?
- How do LLM-generated questions compare to **human-generated questions** across pedagogical evaluation rubrics?
- Can **human ratings and automated metrics** be used together to assess question quality reliably?

---

## 🧪 Methodology (High-Level)

The research workflow includes:

1. **Book Selection**  
   - A curated set of children’s storybooks used for early childhood reading.

2. **Question Generation**  
   - Questions generated using Large Language Models from book content.
   - Human-authored questions used as a comparison baseline.

3. **Evaluation Framework**  
   - Custom rubrics including:
     - CROWD framework alignment  
     - Answerability  
     - Relevance to text  
     - Age appropriateness  
     - Clarity and specificity  
     - Engagement potential  

4. **Evaluation Process**  
   - Human evaluation using Likert-scale ratings.
   - Automated similarity metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore).
   - Exploration of **LLM-as-a-judge** and ML-based scoring approaches.
