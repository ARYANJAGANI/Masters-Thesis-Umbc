Your task is to generate CROWD questions (Completion, Recall, Open-ended, Distancing, Wh-questions) based on the story.

    Goal: Help the child comprehend the story better, practice language skills, and connect the story to their own experiences.

  . Use simple, precise language appropriate for children aged 4-7. Avoid complex sentences and vocabulary.

    USE THE FOLLOWING CROWD STRATEGY AND EXAMPLES:

    Crowd Questioning strategy:
    C-Completion
    R-Recall
    O-Open-end questions
    W-wh questions
    D-Distancing questions

    Completion Questions: Fill in the blank questions
    E.g. The wild things roared________and gnashed their______ and rolled their _________ and showed their_______.

    Recall Questions: Questions that ask the child to remember aspects of the book.
    E.g. What did Mom call Max when he did lots of mischiefs?

    Open-ended Questions: Statements/Questions that encourage the child to reply in his or her own words.
    E.g. Tell me what you see on this page.
    E.g. How do you know that Max is feeling lonely?

    Wh-questions: Simple wh-questions begin with what, when and where for factual information in the text.
    E.g. What’s this?
    E.g. Where is Max?

    Distancing Questions: Questions teachers ask to relate the elements of the book to prior/future experiences of the child.
    E.g. What happened when you had a time-out?

    Higher-Level Question Prompts:
    How do you think if you were_______?
    How do you feel if we/you/_________?
    How do you know?
    How did he/she/it _____?
    Why do you think so?
    What happened last time when you _________?
CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW):

1. NO INVENTED DETAILS:
   Do NOT add events, characters, places, or objects that are not explicitly mentioned in the book.

2. STAY TEXT-ACCURATE:
   All questions must stay strictly faithful to the story.
   Do NOT assume hidden meanings, extra scenes, or information not provided.

3. AGE-APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE:
   Keep questions short, clear, and simple, especially for young learners (Pre-K to Grade 2).

4. COMPLETION QUESTIONS:
   Use ONLY ONE blank.
   Provide full context before the blank.
   Never use multiple blanks or remove too much information.

5. DISTANCING QUESTIONS:
   Connect only to the child’s real-life experiences —
   NOT to fictional characters or imaginary situations outside the book.

6. WH-QUESTIONS:
   Use only when the book provides clear details.
   Do NOT ask “when,” “where,” or “why” questions if the story does not provide that information.

7. NO COMPLEX MULTI-PART QUESTIONS:
   Ask ONLY one idea per question.
   Avoid lists, long sequences, or multi-step recall demands.

# 8. GRADE LEVEL ALIGNMENT:
#    - Pre-K / K → Completion, Recall, simple Wh-questions only.
#    - Grades 1–2 → Basic inference, simple cause/effect.
#    - Grades 3–4 → Character actions, motives, short explanations.
#    - Grades 5–6 → Themes, comparisons, deeper reasoning.

9. NEVER SUMMARIZE OR RETELL THE STORY:
   Only generate the question — do not explain the book or add extra descriptions.

10. DO NOT GENERATE A QUESTION UNLESS THE USER ASKS FOR ONE:
    If the user has not requested a CROWD question, do not produce one automatically.

    Title: {book_title}
    Author: {author}
Grade: K–1

You MUST output:
2 Completion
2 Recall
2 Wh-Question
2 Open-Ended
2 Distancing

Wh-Question: <question>
Open-Ended: <question>
Open-Ended: <question>
Distancing: <question>

RULES:
- No JSON
- No bullets
- No numbering
- No explanations
